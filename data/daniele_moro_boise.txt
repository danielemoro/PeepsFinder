After starting 14 years ago as a weekend intern giving tours at the Old Idaho Penitentiary, alumna Amber Beierle is now historic sites administrator for the Idaho State Historical Society. She is arguably the most knowledgeable person in the state about the Old Penitentiary   a significant site that opened before Idaho became a state and housed inmates until the early 1970s.
Learn how Beierle’s creative efforts, help history come alive for visitors to the historic penitentiary.

Daniele Moro continues to be recognized for his scholarship and achievement in undergraduate research, being named as a finalist for the Computer Research Association’s (CRA) Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award, an award that recognizes undergraduate students in North American colleges and universities who show outstanding research potential in an area of computing research. A third year student in the Boise State computer science program, Daniele is a member of the Speech, Language and Interactive Machines (SLIM) Lab advised by Dr. Casey Kennington and his research seeks to  make computers understand human body language so that humans and computers and robots can augment each other, help each other, and do better things.  This past spring Daniele was also named a Goldwater Scholar.

Aprajita Shukla is working on her Master’s in Computer Science at Boise State. She is from India, and is working on improving Spoken Dialogue Systems using machine learning and improved user interfaces. Quote:  May the next few months be a period of magnificent transformation.


Daniele Moro is an undergraduate student at Boise State University studying Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics. After completing a summer research internship at Carnegie Mellon University where he created a neural network to control a soft robotic hand, he discovered that he is fascinated by technologies such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and human computer interaction. Daniele leads the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers student branch at BSU and enjoys watching Star Trek.


David McNeill is an (aspiring) Data Scientist who is in his first year of Boise State’s MS in CS program. He has a background in education, but instead of teaching human children these days you can find him training embodied machines (robots!) how to use language based on data collected from their very own  senses.  He believes that by giving people and their machines a common ground in communication, this research can allow more   and more kinds   of people to use the increasingly sophisticated tools that surround us in our daily lives.


Jake Carns finished his Bachelors in Computer Science at Boise State and is currently working on his Master’s in CS. Jake has spent 6 years working in Information Technology as a Systems Administrator for a medical billing and coding company. Interested in data science, machine learning, and natural language processing, he is currently working to understand and improve technologies in the healthcare setting. He likes reading, hiking, and snowboarding.


Andrew Rafla is a Master’s Computer Science student and Student Athlete who received his B.S. in Computer Science with a double minor in Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics from Boise State in 2018. He is currently working on a project in the field of Natural Language Processing improving upon an open source Spoken Dialogue System.


Gerardo Caracasworks at Kount inc., He is originally from Mexico City where he studied Cybernetic Engineering. He looks forward on contributing as a part time student in the area of AI research at BSU


An educator in Japan and America turned AI researcher and master’s student, Sam is working in semantics (specifically methodologies of encoding semantics into AI systems), deep learning, NLP, and machine learning. Sam enjoys family, friends, food, and pretending that he can compete at ninja warrior.

Hello all,
This week we will visit a place that is very near to home, yet (at least for me) it is very unknown. We be touring the BSU Idaho Microfabrication Laboratory and Cleanroom!
Tour: Boise State Idaho Microfabrication Laboratory and Cleanroom
This week Sumedha Gandharava will guide us through the Idaho Microfabrication Laboratory found on the first floor of the Engineering building. This is an exciting opportunity to tour the complex (and oftentimes expensive) machinery that is found on our very own campus! In addition to understanding the tools and resources available to engineering students at Boise State, you will finally be able to talk to people about the weird glowing rooms everyone always walks by.
The IML is equipped to fabricate microelectronic devices using various thin film deposition techniques, chemical processing, photolithography, and plasma etching.  (
UPCOMING TOUR: Micron Cleanroom
We will have the AMAZING opportunity to tour the Micron Cleanroom on April 5th at 4:30pm.
However, to attend this tour, you will need to sign up here:
We can only bring a limited number of people, so sign up now!
UPDATE: NEW POLL FOR AFTER SPRING BREAK
Does the meeting time not work for you?
If you want us to schedule meetings at times YOU are available, let us know your weekly availability

Are you interested, curious, or knowledgeable about Artificial Intelligence? The AI Club is a group of students (both undergraduate and graduate) that are interested in AI and seek a place to talk about it. Our goal is to form a community of interested students that share knowledge, passion, and skills. Let us know if you are interested.
What do you mean by Artificial Intelligence (AI)? We like to give AI a broad definition. From Data Science, to Machine Learning, to Computer Vision, to Autonomous Robots, to Natural Language Processing, to Self Driving Cars; we will explore all of these fields.
What do we do?    Listen to guest speakers knowledgeable in AI fields (industry experts, researchers, or graduate students)    Discuss the latest greatest cool stuff happening in AI    Skills workshops    Talk about the philosophical and ethical questions in AI    Network and socialize with like minded peers
Who should join?    Those curious or interested in AI and want to talk about it    Anyone who wants to learn more about AI    Anyone working with AI that would like to share their ideas or research with others
We do not want this club to take up too much time from your busy life, so we hope for it to be a fun and relaxing time to talk about something you are passionate about: Artificial Intelligence!
Special Interest
