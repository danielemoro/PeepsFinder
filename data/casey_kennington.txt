For students who wish to have me as their primary advisor: I am happy to work with hard working and enthusiastic students. It's not enough to be  interested  in NLP or AI, please be clear as to why you want to work with me.
For students who wish to have me serve on their committee: At any time I serve on many committees, so if you wish to include me as a committee member on your thesis or dissertation committee, please be clear about why you want me on your committee. Even though I teach courses in Deep Learning and NLP, there are other faculty members who do research in these areas as well.

Short Bio: I grew up on a dairy farm in rural Ontario, Oregon, U.S.A. After spending two years as a missionary in the Tohoku region of Japan, I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from Brigham Young University. My master's work was done in the Erasmus Mundus European Masters in Language and Communication Technology program, where I spent my first year at Saarland University in Saarbr cken, Germany, and my second year at Nancy 2 University (now Lorraine University) in Nancy, France. My thesis was supervised by Professor Martin Kay of Stanford University. During my master's, I worked at the German Institute for Artificial Intelilgence (DFKI). I graduated with a Ph.D from Bielefeld University advised by David Schlangen. During my Ph.D studies, I spent 3 months as an intern at Honda Research Institute, supervised by Kotaro Funakoshi. My post doctoral work was in the KogniHome project working on dialogue management for an intelligent apartment project.
I am currently an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department of Boise State University.

We propose a method for temporal alignments  a precondition of meaningful fusions  of multimodal systems, using the incremental unit dialogue system framework, which gives the system flexibility in how it handles alignment: either by delaying a modality for a specified amount of time, or by revoking (i.e., backtracking) processed information so multiple information sources can be processed jointly. We evaluate our approach in an offline experiment with multimodal data and find that using the incremental framework is flexible and shows promise as a solution to the problem of temporal alignment in multimodal systems.
